## Flutter Nearby Messages plugin

### Description

This is unofficial flutter plugin, a simple wrapper around native iOS and Android libraries provided by Google.
Check overview [here](https://developers.google.com/nearby/messages/overview).

I think it's the most underrated technology Google has made.
It allows you to transfer small payloads between nearby devices without paring.
Run example to understand, what I'm talking about.

### Usage

Coming soon =)

### License

This plugin is licensed under WTFPL, however it depends on Google's libraries, which aren't covered by this license.
It covers only source code in this repository.
